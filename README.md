# 🔐 Mesh Labs — Learn Decentralized Networking by Building Microapps

Welcome! This is a self-directed learning course in which I, as a frontend developer, explore decentralized infrastructure by building a series of 7 progressively complex microapps.

Each microapp focuses on core topics like:

- Peer-to-peer communication (P2P)
- Mesh networks
- Cryptographic key management
- Key-based authentication (no login)
- Identity without central authority
- IP pool and invite systems
- WebRTC & secure messaging

| 2   | 📲 QR Linker       | QR Code, Key Signatures    | Bind identity to key using signed QR code          |
| 3   | 🎟️ Invite Minting  | CIDR IP pools, Backend API | Create invite tokens tied to limited IP resources  |
| 4   | 🛂 Key Dashboard   | Stateless Auth, UI UX      | Access dashboard based on key signature            |
| 5   | 🗂️ IP Pool Manager | Supabase/Express + UI      | Manage IP invites, rate-limit logic                |
| 6   | 🛰️ P2P Messenger   | WebRTC, QR-based Signaling | Private peer-to-peer chat                          |
| 7   | 🧱 Mesh Node Sync  | Graph sync logic           | Synchronize node status and trust edges            |

## 🧠 Goal

To deeply understand how to build a secure, decentralized, invitation-only network using frontend-first technologies and cryptographic primitives — and grow my engineering skills beyond traditional web development.

## 🚧 Status

Work in progress. One microapp at a time.
