# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QR Linker microapp enables secure message signing and verification through QR codes. Users can sign messages with their Ed25519 private key, encode the signed message into a QR code, and verify signatures on other devices by scanning QR codes. This creates a bridge for secure communication and identity verification across devices without requiring network connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with an Ed25519 keypair, I want to sign a message with my private key, so that I can prove the authenticity of my message to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a text message THEN the system SHALL allow them to sign it with their stored private key
2. WHEN a user clicks the sign button THEN the system SHALL generate a digital signature using Ed25519 algorithm
3. WHEN the signing process completes THEN the system SHALL display the original message and its signature
4. IF no private key is available THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to generate or import a keypair
5. WHEN signing fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a signed message, I want to encode it into a QR code, so that I can share it with other devices without network connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is successfully signed THEN the system SHALL generate a QR code containing the message, signature, and public key
2. WHEN the QR code is generated THEN the system SHALL display it prominently for scanning
3. WHEN the QR code data exceeds standard capacity THEN the system SHALL warn the user about message length limitations
4. WHEN generating the QR code THEN the system SHALL use a structured format that includes all necessary verification data
5. WHEN the QR code is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to download or print it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with a QR code scanner, I want to scan and verify signed messages, so that I can confirm the authenticity and integrity of received messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates the scanner THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN a valid QR code is scanned THEN the system SHALL extract the message, signature, and public key
3. WHEN verification data is extracted THEN the system SHALL verify the signature against the message using the provided public key
4. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the verified message with a success indicator
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the signature is invalid
6. WHEN an invalid QR code is scanned THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
7. IF camera access is denied THEN the system SHALL provide alternative input methods for QR code data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my keypairs within the QR Linker app, so that I can sign messages without switching between applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing keypairs from the Key Generator app
2. WHEN no keypair exists THEN the system SHALL provide options to generate a new keypair or import an existing one
3. WHEN a keypair is available THEN the system SHALL display the public key for reference
4. WHEN a user generates a new keypair THEN the system SHALL store it securely in browser storage
5. WHEN a user wants to clear their keypair THEN the system SHALL provide a secure confirmation process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline, so that I can sign and verify messages without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is loaded THEN the system SHALL function entirely in the browser without server dependencies
2. WHEN signing messages THEN the system SHALL use client-side cryptographic operations only
3. WHEN generating QR codes THEN the system SHALL use client-side QR generation libraries
4. WHEN scanning QR codes THEN the system SHALL process verification entirely on the client
5. WHEN the app is accessed offline THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want clear feedback about the verification process, so that I can trust the authenticity results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signature is verified THEN the system SHALL display the signer's public key
2. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL show a clear success or failure status
3. WHEN displaying verification results THEN the system SHALL include timestamp information if available
4. WHEN a message is verified THEN the system SHALL highlight any security warnings or considerations
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL explain possible reasons for the failure
